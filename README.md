 Running for benchmarks
 To run a benchmark test, run
 ```
 python3 scripts/run <source> <number of times>
```
where `source` is the name of the source file and `number of times` is the amount of times you want the shape commands to run

example: `python3 scripts/run.py demo 2000`
note, the number of times defaults to 100, which is a little more manageable .
