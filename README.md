 Running for profiling
 To run a benchmark test, run
 ```
 python3 main.py <source>
```
where `source` is the name of the source file and `number of times` is the amount of times you want the shape commands to run

example: `python3 main.py demo clean`

##Tests
From root, run `python3 -m unittest tests/test_shapes.py`
